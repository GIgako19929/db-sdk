# db-sdk
 OrbisDB SDK to create, manage and query open data.

> [!WARNING]  
> This SDK is a work-in-progress and is being developed in parallel with the OrbisDB node.
> Things will change, however, the core components have been ported over from the Orbis Social SDK and should have a stable-enough interface.

> [!NOTE]  
> Initial release of the SDK uses Knex.js as the SELECT query builder. This will change due to compatibility issues and overall behavior control.
